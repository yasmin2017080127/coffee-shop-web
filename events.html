                        <p>We all love a good cup of coffee. Admittedly, sometimes just to perk us up in the morning or catch a wifi hotspot.
                        But when it comes to doing it properly, and having fun whilst at it, the decision's tough when it comes to San Fran. 
                        We've mentioned our adoration for Sightglass Coffee before , but its time for a more comprehensive list. 
                        So, here's a list of trendy cafes in the bay area which offer both quality coffee and some truly special events.</p>
